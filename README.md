## Exercise 6- Arithmetic Expression Examples

We will now explore some basic Python code examples for performing arithmetic operations.

# Exercise 7

num1 = 10

num2 = 5

# Multiplication
product = num1 * num2

print("Multiplication:", product)

# Addition
sum = num1 + num2

print("Addition:", sum)


# Exercise 8 - Convert Minutes to Hours
minutes = 120

hours = minutes / 60

print(hours)
